That's a project made from video lessons (semana Omnistack 10) from the company Rocketseat.

This project has the purpose of registering and viewing programmers and their respective locations.
This project uses the Google Maps and GitHub API.
To be viewed, the inputs must be the technology that the programmer has registered.

This project needs an IDE to run and internet access, as it works from local hosting
